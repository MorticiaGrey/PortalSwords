# PortalSwords

PortalSwords is a mod which adds end game swords capable of teleporting the player to and from dimensions at will. These are the Riftstalker and Hellstalker
respectively. The Riftstalker can teleport the player to the end while the Hellstalker can teleport the player to the nether.

## Recipes

Each sword can be crafted with three components: the hilt, crossguard, and blade.

### Riftstalker

The Riftstalker is constructed from the reinforced hilt, reinforced crossguard, and rift blade.

The hilt is crafted with two shulker shells on top and bottom of a piece of obsidian, the crossguard is made with shulker shells on the left and right of
an end crystal, and finally the rift blade is made by putting shulker shells on top and bottom of a dragon egg. You then combine these together in the center
of a crafting table to acquire the Riftstalker.

### Hellstalker

The Hellstalker is constructed from the fiery hilt, fiery crossguard, and hell blade.

The hilt is crafted with two netherite ingots on top and bottom of a magma block, the crossguard is made with netherite ingots on the left and right of
a lava bucket, and finally the hell blade is made by putting netherite ingots on top and bottom of a nether star. You then combine these together in the center
of a crafting table to acquire the Hellstalker.

Of course the Hellstalker is notably more expensive, and is such more powerful. The riftstalker is easier to get but not the better of the two. Also please
note that the swords can only be repaired with mending, there is no other way to restore durability.
